# Overview
There is a long history of lending discrimination based on race in the United States. Lenders have literally drawn red lines on a map around certain neighbourhoods where they would not offer loans, based on the racial demographics of those neighbourhoods (read more about redlining here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining). In 1975, congress passed the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HDMA) to bring more transparency to this injustice (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Mortgage_Disclosure_Act). The idea is that banks must report details about loan applications and which loans they decided to approve.

The public HDMA dataset spans all the states and many years, and is documented here:

In this project, I'll analyze every loan application made in Wisconsin in 2020.

Things I'll practice:
-classes
-large datasets
-trees
-writing modules
